# Decent Password Generator

## Description

This project is an attempt at building a functional random password generator. It is built using JavaScript over raw HTML and CSS, and is majority JavaScript in content. The app is designed so that when a user hits the button to generate a password, they are given a set of prompts via window notifications of how long the user would like their password to be as well as what character sets they would like to include in their password. After the questions have run, the answers provided by the user are then validated through the code, and if the input passes all the checks, a password is randomly generated that fits with the users criteria and is displayed on the page. The app can be used to create as many different passwords as desired, each with differing criteria, if needed. The app in the webpage is seen below for reference:

In this project, I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all interact. I also learned all the basic JavaScript associated with such a project as well as best practices when coding JavaScript. Through building the project, I learned the importance of constant and consistent testing of your code as you work, how to identify and correct the bugs that inevitably pop up, and the ability to take advantages of the available resources when you get stuck (i.e. internet, classmates, instructors, etc.). A project like this that you have to build and figure out yourself really hones the skill of searching the web, knowing what you are looking for and what to search, as well as finding or tweaking answers to best serve your purposes. 

The live site with the completed app can be found [here](https://cynogriffin.github.io/decent-password-generator/). Please feel free to use and test the application and let me know of any possible improvements or suggestions.

## Installation and Usage

As an in-browser web application, there is no environment setup or installation needed. Simply load the page in your browser and the app should be fully functional.

To use, you can follow the steps as listed below:
1. To start running the application, click on the red "Generate Password" button.

4. Lastly, after all the desires password criteria is collected and validated by the application, the generated password will be displayed in the password box in the window.
